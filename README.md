### Usage
Download the jar files contained in the deliverables/final/jar folder.
The jar files contain the project dependencies, so only Java 15 should be needed for execution.
Place the jar files in a folder: their execution will generate here logging and save files.
Run the jar files from command line. For example, to run the server in windows:
> java -jar MastersOfRenaissance_server.jar

Follow the command line instructions to play.
